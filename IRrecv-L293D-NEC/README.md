I have 4 old Geotrax toy Locomotives. They don't work anymore and the electronics have gone. In this project I'm trying to:
a) Design and Arduino Nano based IR receiver in the Locomotive that perform the four basic commands:
    1) Move Forward
    2) Emit a sound
    3) Stop
    4) Move Backward (for some of the Locomotives)
b) Desing the electronics of the Transmitter

If I manage to complete this project I'd like to load on github:
a) The Arduino schemes of the Receiver and motor driver of the Locomotive
b) The Arduino code
c) The electronics schemas of the IR transmitter

I'm an Arduino begginer. Any contribution is welcome!!!
